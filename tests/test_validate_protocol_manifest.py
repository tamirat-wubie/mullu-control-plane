"""Tests for the public governance protocol manifest.

Purpose: prove deployment orchestration receipts are indexed as public
handoff contracts.
Governance scope: [OCE, RAG, CDCV, CQTE, UWMA, PRS]
Dependencies: scripts.validate_protocol_manifest and schema manifest JSON.
Invariants:
  - Every public top-level schema is listed in the protocol manifest.
  - Deployment orchestration receipts have a stable schema id and URN.
  - Missing deployment handoff schema entries fail closed.
