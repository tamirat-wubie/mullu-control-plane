# Mullu Platform — Production Deployment Guide

**Audience:** operators deploying the Mullu Control Plane to pilot or production
**Status:** authoritative as of v4.37.0
**Companion docs:** [`DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`](DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) (pre-flight tickbox), [`MAF_RECEIPT_COVERAGE.md`](MAF_RECEIPT_COVERAGE.md) (receipt coverage invariant)

This document is the deployment-time reference for the audit-grade hardening shipped between v4.26 and v4.37. Every required env var, every error code introduced by an audit fix, every capacity-sizing number is here. If you're deploying for the first time, read this end-to-end. If you're upgrading, read the [Upgrade matrix](#upgrade-matrix) and the env-var rows that changed.

## Quick start

Minimum viable production manifest:

```yaml
env:
  - name: MULLU_ENV
    value: "production"
  - name: MULLU_ENV_REQUIRED
    value: "true"
  - name: MULLU_DB_BACKEND
    value: "postgresql"
  - name: MULLU_DB_URL
    valueFrom: { secretKeyRef: { name: mullu-db, key: url } }
  - name: MULLU_DB_POOL_SIZE
    value: "10"
  - name: MULLU_CORS_ORIGINS
    value: "https://app.example.com,https://admin.example.com"
  - name: MULLU_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_TENANTS
    value: "false"
  - name: MULLU_ENCRYPTION_KEY
    valueFrom: { secretKeyRef: { name: mullu-keys, key: encryption } }
  - name: MULLU_JWT_SECRET
    valueFrom: { secretKeyRef: { name: mullu-keys, key: jwt } }
  - name: MULLU_JWT_ISSUER
    value: "https://auth.example.com"
  - name: MULLU_JWT_AUDIENCE
    value: "mullu-api"
  - name: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    valueFrom: { secretKeyRef: { name: mullu-llm, key: anthropic } }
```

After deploy, verify:

```bash
curl https://your-host/health   # → {"status":"healthy"}
curl https://your-host/ready    # → 200 with subsystem status
```

If `MULLU_ENV_REQUIRED=true` but `MULLU_ENV` is missing, the platform refuses to start with `EnvBindingError`. That's intended.

## Environment variable reference

Variables are grouped by purpose. Every row marks whether the variable is **required** in production, what audit fracture it relates to (if any), and what happens if you get it wrong.

### Core environment binding

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MULLU_ENV` | **yes (production)** | `local_dev` | Must be `local_dev` / `test` / `pilot` / `production`. Unknown values fall to sandboxed shell policy with an ERROR log. F5. |
| `MULLU_ENV_REQUIRED` | **yes (production)** | unset | Set to `true`/`1`/`yes`/`on` to make missing `MULLU_ENV` a hard `EnvBindingError` at boot rather than a silent `local_dev` fallback. F5 hardening from v4.35. |

### Persistence

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MULLU_DB_BACKEND` | **yes (production)** | `memory` | `memory` / `sqlite` / `postgresql`. Production must be `postgresql` — `memory` triggers a startup warning in non-dev envs. **Note:** value is `postgresql` (not `postgres`). |
| `MULLU_DB_URL` | **yes (postgresql)** | unset | psycopg2 DSN, e.g. `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/mullu`. |
| `MULLU_DB_POOL_SIZE` | recommended | `1` | Per-store connection-pool cap. v4.36 added pool support to governance stores; v4.37 to the primary store. **Total PG connections = `replicas × 5 × pool_size`** (4 governance stores + 1 primary). Defaults to 1 = legacy single-conn (with the v4.37 lock fix). Typical production value: 5–10. F12. |

### Authentication

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MULLU_JWT_SECRET` | recommended | unset | Base64-encoded HMAC secret for HS256/HS384/HS512. When set, JWT auth is enabled. v4.33 hardened: empty `sub` / empty tenant claim / future `iat` rejected. |
| `MULLU_JWT_ISSUER` | yes (if JWT) | `mullu` | Expected `iss` claim. |
| `MULLU_JWT_AUDIENCE` | yes (if JWT) | `mullu-api` | Expected `aud` claim. |
| `MULLU_JWT_TENANT_CLAIM` | optional | `tenant_id` | JWT claim name carrying the tenant identifier. |
| `MULLU_API_AUTH_REQUIRED` | recommended | unset | When truthy, all `/api/*` requests must carry a valid Authorization header. F16-aligned. |
| `MULLU_ALLOW_WILDCARD_API_KEYS` | **no in production** | unset | When truthy, allows API keys with scope `*` to be created. Defense-in-depth: keep unset in production so wildcard keys must be explicitly minted via the admin path. |

### CORS / network

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MULLU_CORS_ORIGINS` | **yes (production)** | unset | Comma-separated allowlist. Wildcard `*` is rejected in `pilot`/`production`. Empty value in non-dev envs triggers a startup warning. |

### Tenant gating

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MULLU_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_TENANTS` | **no in production** | env-derived (`true` only in `local_dev`/`test`) | When truthy, a tenant_id never seen before passes the tenant gate. **Always `false` in production.** |

### Field encryption (audit at rest)

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MULLU_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | **yes (production)** | unset | Base64-encoded 32-byte key for AES-GCM field encryption of audit `detail` JSONB. When unset, audit detail is stored plaintext. The startup posture validator warns loudly if encryption is unconfigured in non-dev envs. |

### Shell sandbox (governed code execution)

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MULLU_SHELL_EXECUTION_ENABLED` | optional | `false` (effective) | When truthy AND `MULLU_ENV` is `pilot`/`production`, shell execution uses `PILOT_PROD` policy. When unset/false, uses `PILOT_PROD_DISABLED` (shell off). Unknown environments always fall to `SANDBOXED`. |

### LLM provider configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MULLU_LLM_BACKEND` | optional | auto-detect | `anthropic`/`openai`/`gemini`/`ollama`/`stub`. When unset, picks the first provider with a configured API key (Tier 1 priority: anthropic → openai → gemini → ollama). Setting `stub` in pilot/production raises a hard error. |
| `MULLU_LLM_MODEL` | optional | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Default model name for the chosen backend. |
| `MULLU_LLM_BUDGET_MAX_COST` | optional | `100.0` | Default per-tenant cost budget (USD). Atomic budget enforcement from v4.27. F2. |
| `MULLU_LLM_BUDGET_MAX_CALLS` | optional | `10000` | Default per-tenant call cap. |
| `MULLU_LLM_MAX_TOKENS` | optional | `4096` | Per-call token cap. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | one provider required | unset | |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | " | unset | |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | " | unset | |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | " | unset | Local Ollama endpoint. |

### Background workers / certification

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MULLU_CERT_ENABLED` | optional | `true` | Periodic certification daemon. |
| `MULLU_CERT_INTERVAL` | optional | `300` (seconds) | Certification cadence. Set to `0` in tests to disable. |
| `MULLU_PII_SCAN` | optional | `true` | PII scanner on input/output content. |

### State directories

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MULLU_STATE_DIR` | optional | tempdir | Persistence root for capability state. Mount to a PVC in production. |
| `MULLU_DATA_DIR` | optional | tempdir | Coordination scratch space. |
| `MULLU_COORDINATION_DIR` | optional | derived from `MULLU_DATA_DIR` | Coordination engine state. |

### Gateway channels (optional, install per channel)

| Variable group | Channel |
|---|---|
| `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` + `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` + `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` | WhatsApp |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` + `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Slack |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` + `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY` | Discord |

## Audit-fracture → env-var mapping

If you've read the audit report and want to verify each fracture's mitigation is wired:

| Fracture | Status | Required env-var setting in production |
|---|---|---|
| F2 atomic budget | v4.27 | `MULLU_DB_BACKEND=postgresql` (atomic SQL UPDATE only kicks in on PG) |
| F3 audit checkpoint | v4.28 | `MULLU_DB_BACKEND=postgresql` |
| F4 atomic audit append | v4.31 | `MULLU_DB_BACKEND=postgresql` + `MULLU_ENCRYPTION_KEY` for at-rest |
| F5 env binding | v4.35 | `MULLU_ENV=production` + `MULLU_ENV_REQUIRED=true` |
| F6 tenant binding | v4.35 | (automatic — middleware sets `tenant_id_explicit` per-request) |
| F9 webhook SSRF | v4.32 | (automatic — unified SSRF policy applies to webhook subscribe + delivery) |
| F10 DNS rebinding | v4.32 | (automatic — http_connector pins resolved IP) |
| F11 atomic rate limit | v4.29 + v4.34 | `MULLU_DB_BACKEND=postgresql` |
| F12 connection pool | v4.36 + v4.37 | `MULLU_DB_POOL_SIZE` ≥ 5 (recommended) |
| F15 atomic hash chain | v4.30 | `MULLU_DB_BACKEND=postgresql` |
| F16 musia_auth wiring | v4.26 | `MULLU_JWT_SECRET` + `MULLU_API_AUTH_REQUIRED=true` |
| JWT hardening | v4.33 | `MULLU_JWT_SECRET` (default flags reject empty `sub`/tenant + future `iat` + `http://` JWKS) |

If any row says "Status: vXY" but the mitigation isn't visible at runtime, you have a misconfiguration — see the troubleshooting section below.

## Capacity sizing

### PostgreSQL `max_connections`

Total connections from one Mullu replica:

```
per_replica = 4 (governance stores) + 1 (primary store) = 5 stores
total_pg_connections = replicas × 5 × MULLU_DB_POOL_SIZE
```

Examples:

| Replicas | `MULLU_DB_POOL_SIZE` | PG connections |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 5 |
| 3 | 5 | 75 |
| 3 | 10 | 150 |
| 5 | 10 | 250 |
| 10 | 10 | 500 |

Managed PostgreSQL services typically default `max_connections` to 100–200. Aurora can go higher. **Verify your PG `max_connections` covers `total_pg_connections + headroom for ad-hoc tools (psql / pgAdmin / backups)`.**

If you need more concurrency than `max_connections` allows, put a connection pooler (PgBouncer in `transaction` mode) in front of PG and point `MULLU_DB_URL` at the pooler.

### Pool sizing heuristic

- Start at `pool_size=1` (default). Verify v4.37 deploys cleanly.
- Bump to `pool_size=5` for one bake cycle (a week or your shortest stable window).
- Tune up to `pool_size=10–20` per replica based on observed pool-exhaustion logs.
- Beyond 20: prefer adding replicas rather than growing the pool further. PG benefits from many short connections, not few fat ones.

### Memory footprint

Each Mullu replica with `pool_size=10`:
- Python heap: ~250 MB baseline + ~50 MB per active in-flight request
- 5 × 10 = 50 idle PG connections × ~3 MB each (libpq) = 150 MB
- Recommended container memory limit: 1 GiB

## Error codes & log signals reference

Every audit-grade rejection has a deterministic, bounded error string. Watch for these in your auth log + governance decision log.

### Auth-layer rejections (HTTP 401/403)

| String | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `tenant mismatch` | Request supplied `X-Tenant-ID: B` (or `?tenant_id=B`) on a JWT/key authenticated as tenant A. | F6 v4.35. Either client is buggy (cross-tenant call from a logged-in session), or this is spoofing. |
| `sub claim is empty or missing` | JWT has empty `sub`. | F33 v4.33. Either IdP is misconfigured, or token was forged. |
| `tenant claim is empty or missing` | JWT has empty tenant claim. | F33 v4.33. Check IdP claim mapping. |
| `token iat is in the future` | JWT `iat` exceeds `now + clock_skew`. | F33 v4.33. Clock drift between IdP and Mullu, or forged token. |
| `iat claim must be numeric` | JWT `iat` is non-numeric. | Almost certainly a forged or buggy token. |
| `algorithm not allowed` | JWT signed with an algorithm outside `OIDCConfig.allowed_algorithms`. | Check IdP signing alg matches. |
| `signature verification failed` | JWT signature did not verify. | Wrong secret/key, or the token was tampered with. |
| `redirect_blocked:<code>` | http_connector saw a 3xx and refused to follow it. | F10 v4.32. Defensive — either the URL was supposed to be the canonical one, or someone tried to redirect into private space. |
| `jwks_redirect_blocked:<code>` | JWKS endpoint returned a 3xx. | v4.33. Either JWKS URL is wrong (point to canonical), or someone is trying to substitute keys. |
| `blocked_private_address` | http_connector or webhook delivery target resolved to a private/metadata IP. | F9/F10 v4.32. SSRF defense fired. |
| `blocked_private_address_at_connect:<ip>` | DNS pin caught a rebinding attempt at the socket layer. | F10 v4.32. Defense-in-depth catch — non-zero count means active DNS rebinding (or misconfigured DNS). |
| `policy_requires_https` | http_connector saw `http://` URL but policy required HTTPS. | Operator policy. |
| `response_too_large` | http_connector response exceeded policy `max_response_bytes`. | Operator policy. |

### Governance-guard rejections (HTTP 429/403)

| `blocking_guard` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `rate_limit` | 429 — bucket exhausted. F11 v4.29/v4.34. |
| `budget` | 403 — tenant cost or call budget exhausted. F2 v4.27. |
| `tenant_gating` | 403 — tenant disabled or unknown (`MULLU_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_TENANTS=false`). |
| `tenant` | 400 — tenant_id failed validation (>128 chars). |
| `api_key` | 401 — invalid API key. |
| `jwt` | 403 — JWT validation failed (any reason above). |
| `rbac` | 403 — RBAC denied. |
| `lambda_input_safety` | 403 — content safety chain rejected the prompt/content. |

### Startup-time errors (cause boot to fail)

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `EnvBindingError: MULLU_ENV is not set and MULLU_ENV_REQUIRED=true` | F5 v4.35. Operator removed `MULLU_ENV` from manifest. | Set `MULLU_ENV=production` (or whatever was intended). |
| `RuntimeError: postgres schema migration N failed (...)` | One of the 4 governance migrations failed. | Check PG user has `CREATE TABLE` privilege; check schema isn't already partially-applied. |
| `RuntimeError: RS* algorithms require the 'cryptography' package` | JWT config says RS256/RS384/RS512 but cryptography extra not installed. | `pip install mcoi-runtime[encryption]`. |
| `ValueError: jwks_url must use HTTPS` | F33 v4.33. `jwks_url=http://...` rejected at config. | Use HTTPS. If you really need HTTP (in-cluster sidecar), set `require_https_jwks=False`. |
| `MULLU_LLM_BACKEND='stub' is forbidden in 'production'` | Stub LLM in non-dev env. | Pick a real provider. |

### Startup-time warnings (don't block boot, fix soon)

| Warning | Action |
|---|---|
| `MULLU_ENV is not set; falling back to 'local_dev'` (CRITICAL) | Set `MULLU_ENV` explicitly + `MULLU_ENV_REQUIRED=true`. |
| `MULLU_DB_BACKEND=memory in non-dev environment` | Switch to `postgresql`. State doesn't survive restarts. |
| `MULLU_CORS_ORIGINS contains wildcard` | Replace with explicit allowlist. |
| `MULLU_CORS_ORIGINS is empty in non-dev environment` | Set explicit allowlist. |
| `field encryption is not configured` | Set `MULLU_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. |
| `governance store connection failed` | PG unreachable at boot; store falls back to no-op. State writes are silently lost. **Always treat this as critical.** |
| `governance store pool putconn failed` | A connection was unhealthy when the pool tried to return it. Sporadic = transient PG issue; consistent = pool sizing or `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` mismatch. |

---

## Monitoring & runbook hooks

### Health endpoints

| Endpoint | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `/health` | Process is alive. Use as Kubernetes `livenessProbe`. |
| `/ready` | Subsystems are ready (governance stores reachable, JWT loaded if configured, etc.). Use as `readinessProbe`. |
| `/api/v1/health/deep` | Component-by-component breakdown. Useful for status pages. |

### Metrics (Prometheus exposition)

Available at `/api/v1/metrics` once governance metrics are wired (default in production):

- `mullu_requests_total` — total requests
- `mullu_requests_governed` — requests that passed all guards
- `mullu_requests_rejected` — rejected by some guard
- `mullu_proof_bridge_certification_failures` — proof bridge couldn't certify a decision (non-fatal but indicates a bug)
- `mullu_decision_log_record_failures` — decision log couldn't persist (often correlates with PG issues)
- `mullu_request_analytics_record_failures` — request analytics failed

Plus the v4.21+ chain-evaluation latency histograms.

### Audit chain integrity check

```bash
curl https://your-host/api/v1/audit/chain/verify
# → {"verified": true, "entries": 12345, "checkpoint": "..."}
```

The `checkpoint` field is the v4.28 anchor. Verification re-walks the hash chain from the most recent checkpoint forward.

## Upgrade matrix

If you're at an older version, apply these env-var changes when upgrading:

| Upgrading from → to | Required env-var changes |
|---|---|
| `< v4.26` → `≥ v4.26` | Set `MULLU_API_AUTH_REQUIRED=true` once you've migrated callers to send `Authorization`. Pre-v4.26 dev mode allowed unauthenticated access. |
| `< v4.27` → `≥ v4.27` | None. Atomic budget enforcement is automatic on PG. |
| `< v4.32` → `≥ v4.32` | None. Test code may need updates if it used unresolvable webhook URLs (`http://x`); use real-resolvable hostnames. |
| `< v4.33` → `≥ v4.33` | Confirm your IdP populates `sub` and your `tenant_claim`. If you have a non-compliant IdP, set `OIDCConfig(require_subject=False, require_tenant_claim=False)` programmatically — but production should always reject those. |
| `< v4.35` → `≥ v4.35` | **Add `MULLU_ENV_REQUIRED=true`.** Audit clients sending `X-Tenant-ID` that disagree with the JWT — they now get 403. |
| `< v4.36` → `≥ v4.36` | Optionally set `MULLU_DB_POOL_SIZE`. Without it, governance stores stay single-conn (safe but slow). |
| `< v4.37` → `≥ v4.37` | Same `MULLU_DB_POOL_SIZE` env var now also sizes the primary store pool. Re-validate PG `max_connections` budget. |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I see `MULLU_ENV is not set; falling back to 'local_dev'` in production logs"

You forgot `MULLU_ENV` in the manifest. Add `MULLU_ENV=production` and `MULLU_ENV_REQUIRED=true` together.

### "Tests pass locally but production rejects every request with `tenant mismatch`"

Either your client is sending a stale `X-Tenant-ID` header, or your IdP is issuing tokens for a different tenant than the one the client thinks it's calling. Check the JWT payload's tenant claim against the client's `X-Tenant-ID` value.

### "Pool exhaustion under load"

`MULLU_DB_POOL_SIZE` is too low for your throughput. Symptoms: requests block waiting for `pool.getconn()`. Increase pool size, but verify PG `max_connections` covers it (or add a PgBouncer).

### "PG `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` is killing pool connections"

The pool is serving stale connections. Either reduce PG's timeout, increase pool keepalive (libpq `keepalives` params in DSN), or add a `BEFORE` trigger on connection acquisition that pings PG. Long-term, run with `transaction`-mode PgBouncer.

### "I want to verify the v4.35 fail-closed env binding works"

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e MULLU_ENV_REQUIRED=true \
  -e MULLU_DB_BACKEND=memory \
  mullu-control-plane:v4.37
# → EnvBindingError: MULLU_ENV is not set and MULLU_ENV_REQUIRED=true
```

If the container starts instead of exiting with `EnvBindingError`, your image is older than v4.35.

### "Audit chain reports `verified: false`"

Either the chain was tampered with, or a v4.28-pre-dating prune wiped the genesis anchor. Restore from backup. The v4.28 checkpoint anchor prevents this for new prunes; for old data, you may need to re-anchor manually.

---

## Soft rollout sequence (mandatory)

Even for patch releases, follow:

1. **Shadow / non-prod canary (1 week)** — deploy to a non-prod cluster with production traffic mirrored. Verify no new error-code spikes.
2. **5% canary in production (1 week)** — gradually shift traffic. Monitor:
   - `mullu_requests_rejected` rate (should not increase)
   - PG connection count (should match expected `replicas × 5 × pool_size`)
   - Auth log error-code distribution (any new codes warrant investigation)
3. **25% / 50% / 100% rollout (3 days each)** — bump traffic share, watch the same signals.
4. **Lock the version for at least 7 days at 100% before the next bump.**

For audit-grade hardening releases (any v4.2x – v4.3x), treat the rollout as if it were a major version. The fail-closed posture changes are intentional and not all of them are reversible without a downgrade.
